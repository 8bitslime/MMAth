# MMath
A 3D graphics math library in a single C header file.

MMath currently compiles in Visual Studio and G++ but more testing is required.

More documentation will be added eventually.

##Using MMath
Using MMath is a simple as `#include "MMath.h"` anywhere you want math.
If you want double precision, be sure to define `MMATH_DOUBLE` before including.
